        <description>A primitive and bulky heavy-duty exoskeleton. Although such large wearable exoskeletons have been repeatedly invented since the 22nd century, their design and technical foundations are basically interoperable.\n\nThe application environment of powered frame at the military are close to small mechas or some genetically modified large humanoid soldiers, but its degree of automation is low and requires the driver to use full body control, and relies on specialized maintenance platform to put on and take off</description>
